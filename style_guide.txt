1. Clarity and Concision Rules

Lead with main idea in first sentence
Use simple vocabulary (avoid jargon unless necessary and defined)
Eliminate redundant phrases:

"in order to" → "to"
"due to the fact that" → "because"
"at this point in time" → "now"



2. Punctuation Standards

Period (.) - Sentence terminator
Comma (,) - List separator, pause indicator, before coordinating conjunctions joining independent clauses
Question mark (?) - Query terminator
Exclamation point (!) - Emotion indicator (use minimally)
Apostrophe (') - Possession marker, contraction indicator

3. Grammar Error Prevention
Common Confusion Pairs:

your (possessive) vs you're (you are)
their (possessive) vs there (location) vs they're (they are)
its (possessive) vs it's (it is)

4. Text Structure Requirements

Use hierarchical headings for organization
One main concept per paragraph
Maximum paragraph length: 4-5 sentences
Use lists for sequential/grouped information
Apply emphasis (bold/italic) selectively

5. Quality Control Process

Read aloud test for flow
Systematic proofreading (spelling, grammar, typos)
Third-party review when possible
Iterative revision until clarity achieved

6. Implementation Priority
High Priority: Clarity, concision, correct grammar
Medium Priority: Formatting, structure
Low Priority: Stylistic flourishes, complex vocabulary
